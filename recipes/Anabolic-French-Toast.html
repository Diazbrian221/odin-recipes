    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Slices Sara Lee honey wheat bread
            (or low calorie sliced bread alternative)
        </li>
        <li>3/4ths of a cup of liquid egg whites
            (If using regular eggs, add water to thin)
        </li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 packets of splenda (add more if desired)</li>
        <li>Pam spray or oil spray alternative</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the egg whites and put it in
            a mixing bowl. Add cinnamon, vanilla extract,
            and splenda packets and whisk together.
        </li>
        <li>On a medium-low heated skillet,
            spray your oil just enough so that it covers
            the whole pan.
        </li>
        <li>Take your bread slices and soak them
            in the egg white mixture, flip so each side
            has absorbed the mixture.
        </li>
        <li>Place bread slices on the skillet.
            Pour any of the remaining mixture on the bread slices slowly.
        </li>
        <li>After 2-3 minutes, flip bread slices.</li>
        <li>Cook until both sides are firm and golden-dark brown.</li>
        <li>Serve with low calorie syrup and/or berries and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
